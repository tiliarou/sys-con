# sys-con

#### A Nintedo Switch sysmodule for third-party controller support. No man-in-the-middle required! 
###### \[Switch FW 5.0.0+\]


## Description
This sysmodule aims to provide complete functionality for most popular game controllers not supported by Nintendo Switch.
At the current moment, **only USB connection** is supported. 

This app is missing a lot of features. For more information, see the [issues page](https://github.com/cathery/sys-con/issues).

## Install

Grab the latest zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/cathery/sys-con/releases). Extract it in your SD card and boot/reboot your switch.

## Config

sys-con comes with a config folder located at `sdmc:/config/sys-con/`. It contains options for adjusting stick/trigger deadzone, as well as remapping inputs. For more information, see `example.ini` in the same folder. All changes to the files will be updated in real time.
