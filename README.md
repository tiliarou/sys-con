# sys-con

#### A Nintedo Switch sysmodule for third-party controller support. No man-in-the-middle required! 
###### \[Switch FW 5.0.0+\]


## Description
This sysmodule aims to provide complete functionality for most popular game controllers not supported by Nintendo Switch.
At the current moment, **only USB connection** is supported. 

This app is missing a lot of features. For more information, see the [issues page](https://github.com/cathery/sys-con/issues).

## Install

Grab the latest zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/cathery/sys-con/releases). Extract it in your SD card and boot/reboot your switch.

If you want to make sure, the file should be located in `sdmc:/atmosphere/titles/690000000000000D/exefs.nsp`

At the current moment I don't have a Dualshock 4 or a Bluetooth adapter, or the means to afford them. If you wish to see added support for it in the future, consider funding my project on Ko-fi!
